Tserunyan, which proves the treeability of equivalence relations generated by any locally-finite Borel graph such that each component is a quasi-tree. More generally, we show that if each component of a locally-finite Borel graph admits a finitely-separating Borel family of cuts, then we may ‘canonically’ replace each component of the graph by a tree of special ultrafilter-like objects on cuts called orientations; moreover, if the cuts are dense towards ends, then the union of these trees is a Borel treeing.",

        "abstract": "Countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs) have been extensively studied within the framework of descriptive set theory, and a powerful way of analyzing them is by understanding what countable structures one can uniformly assign to each equivalence class in a Borel way. For instance, a graphing of a CBER E is a Borel graph whose connected components are exactly the E-classes, and a CBER is treeable if it admits an acyclic graphing, called a treeing. Treeable CBERs are analogous to free groups, so, naturally, results stating treeability of certain classes of CBERs are difficult to obtain. A recent such result is by Chen, Poulin, Tao, and Tserunyan, stating that if a CBER E admits a locally-finite graphing whose components are quasi-trees, then E is treeable. Their proof uses geometric-group-theoretic ideas and Stone duality, which we will present. Time permitting, we will also discuss a generalization of this result (which they proved as well), that precisely identifies the structure underlying all treeable CBERs. This is an expository talk based on work by Ruiyuan Chen, Antoine Poulin, Ran Tao, and Anush Tserunyan.",
