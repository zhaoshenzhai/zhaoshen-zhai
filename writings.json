        "abstract": "We construct a system of 33 essential simple closed curves that are pairwise non-homotopic and intersect at most once on the oriented, closed surface of genus 3. Moreover, we show that our construction is saturated, in the sense that it is not properly contained in any other such system of curves.",

The proof relies on geometric properties of the profinite Cayley graph of the pro-$\\mathcal{C}$ completion of free groups, which we develop here following [Rib17].",

Tserunyan, which proves the treeability of equivalence relations generated by any locally-finite Borel graph such that each component is a quasi-tree. More generally, we show that if each component of a locally-finite Borel graph admits a finitely-separating Borel family of cuts, then we may 'canonically' replace each component of the graph by a tree of special ultrafilter-like objects on cuts called orientations; moreover, if the cuts are dense towards ends, then the union of these trees is a Borel treeing.",
