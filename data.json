        "title": "Tree-like graphings of countable Borel equivalence relations",
        "abstract": "Countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs) have been extensively studied within the framework of descriptive set theory, and a powerful way of analyzing them is by understanding what countable structures one can uniformly assign to each equivalence class in a Borel way. For instance, a graphing of a CBER E is a Borel graph whose connected components are exactly the E-classes, and a CBER is treeable if it admits an acyclic graphing, called a treeing. Treeable CBERs are analogous to free groups, so, naturally, results stating treeability of certain classes of CBERs are difficult to obtain. A recent such result is by Chen, Poulin, Tao, and Tserunyan, stating that if a CBER E admits a locally-finite graphing whose components are quasi-trees, then E is treeable. Their proof uses geometric-group-theoretic ideas and Stone duality, which we will present. Time permitting, we will also discuss a generalization of this result (which they proved as well), that precisely identifies the structure underlying all treeable CBERs. This is an expository talk based on work by Ruiyuan Chen, Antoine Poulin, Ran Tao, and Anush Tserunyan.",

More generally, we show that if each component of a locally-finite Borel graph admits a finitely-separating Borel family of cuts, then we may ‘canonically’ replace each component of the graph by a tree of special ultrafilter-like objects on cuts called orientations; moreover, if the cuts are dense towards ends, then the union of these trees is a Borel treeing.",

This expository paper aims to introduce this theory, with the goal classifying all compact Riemann surfaces of genus 0 and 1. To do so, we first develop the basics of covering space theory, which defines the degree of proper holomorphic maps, and then study the sheaf of holomorphic maps on a Riemann surface and their associated cohomology theory. Together, they form the core technical tools of the paper and allow us to connect the function theory of Riemann surfaces to their complex structure. Lastly, we give a glimpse into the non-compact case, namely the Uniformization Theorem, which gives us a tri-fold classification of all Riemann surfaces.",
